## What cocktail can I make

### Description
As a cocktail drinker who is too lazy to go to the shops in search of ingredients,
I want to know what cocktails I can make with the ingredients I have at home -
so that I can enjoy a beverage without having to leave the house.

### Technical Description
• Input: The application can be invoked with a comma separated list of
ingredients the user currently has in stock.

• Output: A list of cocktail names that can be made using the provided
ingredients, one per line. Not all of the specified ingredients must be used, but
each cocktail must only have ingredients from the list. The output may include
additional information that would be useful to the user.
